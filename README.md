# AppChallengeProgram
Appetizer challenge to track and score family appetizer challenge hosted every Christmas Eve

This program was started as a personal project that is used during a family competition held annually. It is created in Python and uses MYSQL for managing the database.

The program has a login section and a section for entering the scores given to other competitors. The scores will all be added up in the end to determine the winner in each
catagory as well as an overall winner.

As of now the database is a local database ran on my computer.
